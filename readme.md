Flood Notification App

"admin" folder
-------------------------
This is for the admin to manage to designate the flood cordinates that happen in the area of district.
You can decide to use it as Web App , Desktop App (Using Electron) or Mobile App (Using Cordova/Capacitor) 
because the template is responsive.
[]: # Language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


"mobile_app" folder
-------------------------
This is for user to know the flood cordinates that happen in the area of district. Mobile app will get notication when the cordinates were designated by admin before using socket io client.

"backend" folder

This is the backend of the app. The notification is sent to the user's phone using socket io server if admin added or updated the flood area detail. The app is being hosted on Heroku.
